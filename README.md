Moved repository to BitBucket as a private repository 
-----------------------------------------------------

Bitbucket website is ugly and outdated, the software sucks horrifically 
but privacy is offered for free and unlimited. 

The github software works with  Bitbucket so   you can avoid using Sourcetree for ever!
