Moved repository to BitBucket as a private repository 
-----------------------------------------------------

Bitbucket website is ugly and outdated, the software to sync remote & local repository sucks horrifically 
but the privacy option of the project is offered for free and unlimited. 

The github software works with  Bitbucket so you can avoid using Sourcetree!
